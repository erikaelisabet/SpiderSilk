# SpiderSilk
The purpose of this study is to enhance the understanding of the expression levels of proteins and the complex interplays between multiple proteins within the spider's abdomen. By doing so, elucidation of the factors influencing the mechanical properties of spider silk will be achieved. By exploring the expression levels and interactions of a broader range of proteins within the spider abdomen, this study enables uncovering previously unrecognized contributors to silk mechanics, thereby enriching our understanding of silk production and properties. More precisely, the study hold an initial investigation into whether the expression patterns of spidroin proteins can account for the mechanical properties of spider silk fibers. Additionally, an exploration into which gene families' expression profiles appear to be most closely linked to silk characteristics will be particularly crucial. This exploration may unveil novel mechanisms contributing to the exceptional qualities of spider silk fibers, thereby laying the groundwork for further important advancements in artificial silk production. An additional long-term objective of revealing the protein mixture based on requested mechanical properties would facilitate the customization of artificial spider silk, thus expanding its potential applications. The ability to manufacture silk fibers with a broad spectrum of mechanical properties could help reduce the reliance on inferior and unsustainable materials that still dominate some industrial domains.

In this folder there is code creating various dataset based on bulk RNA and trancriptomes across over 1600 different spiders. Additionally regressional approaches such as Elastic Net and Randomforest was applied and an extensive Principal componet analysis were conducted. The raw data of this study was obtained from the silkome database published alonside the report
"1000 spider silkomes: Linking sequences to silk physical properties" by Arakawa et al. 2022 (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo6043).   

Intermediate datasets and files can be left uppon request. 

# Folder structure
In the R folder scriptfiles for creating hetamaps using complexheatamaps library can be founs aswell as some code performing Elasticnet in the carrot package of bioconductor. 

In code folder all python code used in the project can be found in different foolders. All the way from connecting annotations to creating large expressional datasets across spiders and grpups of genes.
